  Project: Map Mania v2
  Description: Map Mania v2.  A follow up to Map Mania Lite.  I did not 
  have time for the instructions but I was either going to do a css animation
  that went from an opacity of 0 to 100% and went from a negative top value
  to a positive to reinact a "dropping down" effect.  The cheat code is found by
  zooming in on the island of Antarctica that is inside of Antarctica's gulf.
  When you zoom in close enough, the name should say Berkner.  Follow up
  instructions will be provided
